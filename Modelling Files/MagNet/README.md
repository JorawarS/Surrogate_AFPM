Both files are one eighth models of the AFPM\

The transient file has everything setup for a transient 3d motion solver with no load and a 3phase 100 V 20Hz supply. go to solve->setup transient options to change time steps.

The static 3D file has a setup for a static solve of the afpm at 0, 5 ,10 and 15 degree postions of the rotor . It has DC curent inputs to emulate instantaneous current in a three phase AC supply.
